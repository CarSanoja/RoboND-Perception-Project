# values, while outliers do not fit that model in any circumstance.
# The input to the RANSAC algorithm is a set of observed data values, a parameterized model which 
# can explain or be fitted to the observations, and some confidence parameters.
# RANSAC achieves its goal by iteratively selecting a random subset of the original data. These data 
# are hypothetical inliers and this hypothesis is then tested as follows:
# 	1.) A model is fitted to the hypothetical inliers, i.e. all free parameters of the model are 
# reconstructed from the inliers.
# 	2.) All other data are then tested against the fitted model and, if a point fits well to the estimated 
# model, also considered as a hypothetical inlier.
# 	3.) The estimated model is reasonably good if sufficiently many points have been classified as hypothetical inliers.
# 	4.) The model is reestimated from all hypothetical inliers, because it has only been estimated from 
# the initial set of hypothetical inliers.
# 	5.)Finally, the model is evaluated by estimating the error of the inliers relative to the model.

# the value too high, it could happen, that multiple objects are seen as one cluster. So our recommendation is to just test and try 
# out which value suits your dataset.
